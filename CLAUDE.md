# CLAUDE.md — Boston Café Bikers

Static site + ICS sync for a casual Boston cycling group that rides to cafés.
Tagline: "exploring the city one café at a time".

## Gotchas

- **Default branch is `master`** — locally and on GitHub. There is no `main`; ignore any tooling that assumes one. Workflows keyed on the default branch must say `master`.
- **Headless Chrome screenshots at phone widths lie:** `--window-size=380,…` lays the page out at Chrome's ~500px minimum window width and crops the PNG. For a real 380px layout either iframe the page at width 380 inside a same-origin harness and crop, or drive Chrome over CDP (`--remote-debugging-port=0` + `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`; node's global `WebSocket` is enough) — the CDP route also lets you call `BCB.openRideModal(ev)` and screenshot the modal.

## Deployment

**Live: <https://cafebikers.org/>** (also `/events.json`). Everything headless.

- **Pages source: GitHub Actions**, not "deploy from a branch" (that source only offers `/` or `/docs`; the site lives in `site/`). Check with `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pages` (`build_type` must be `"workflow"`); set it with `gh api -X PUT repos/:owner/:repo/pages -f build_type=workflow`. The leftover `source: {branch: master, path: "/"}` is ignored — don't fix it.
- **What deploys:** `.github/workflows/pages.yml` assembles `_site/` from **three checkouts** — `master` → root, `dev` → `preview/`, and the `data` branch overlaid onto both (see the preview bullet) — uploads it via `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and publishes it with `actions/deploy-pages`.
- **The generated data lives on its own orphan branch, `data`** (2026-08-29). `events.json`, `events-past.json`, `cafe-points.json`, `rides.ics`, `maps/` and `posters/` sit at that branch's **root**, laid out exactly as they sat inside `site/`, so no published URL moved and `webcal://…/rides.ics` subscribers noticed nothing. They are gitignored on `master`/`dev`; `scripts/pull_data.sh [remote]` (default `origin`; `git fetch` + `git archive` of those six paths, the branch's own `README.md` deliberately left behind) pulls them into `site/` for local dev. **Why:** the two code branches used to each carry a copy, which doubled every call to Partiful/BRouter/OSM/Nominatim, interleaved ~16–20 bot commits a month into each branch's history, and collided on merge (`3833c7b`, 2026-08-23, was a hand-resolved conflict on `site/events.json`). The `github-pages` environment's branch allow-list does **not** need `data` — nothing triggered on `data` ever deploys; only `pages.yml`, running on `master`/`dev`/`workflow_call`, reads it.
