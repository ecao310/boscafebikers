# Boston Café Bikers — Plan

Static site for Boston Café Bikers ("exploring the city one café at a time"),
with a ride schedule auto-synced from the organizer's Partiful ICS calendar feed.

## Backlog

- [x] Init repo: git init, .gitignore, PLAN.md (copy of this Backlog),
  CLAUDE.md with file map and conventions, requirements.txt (icalendar, requests)
- [x] Create tests/fixtures/sample.ics with 4 realistic Partiful-style events:
  2 future, 1 past, 1 cancelled; include RSVP URLs in descriptions
- [x] Write scripts/fetch_rides.py per spec; run it on the fixture and confirm
  site/events.json contains exactly the 2 future events, sorted by date
- [x] Add tests/test_fetch_rides.py (pytest): past-event filtering, cancelled
  filtering, RSVP link extraction, timezone correctness, malformed-feed exit code
- [x] Write site/index.html hero + about + first-ride + links sections with
  placeholder schedule area
- [x] Add schedule rendering JS: load events.json, render ride cards
  (date, time, start location, RSVP button), last-updated stamp, empty-state
  fallback to the Partiful profile
- [x] Create .github/workflows/sync.yml per spec (cron `0 */6 * * *`,
  workflow_dispatch, commit-if-changed guard)
- [x] Add README.md: what this is, how to get the ICS URL from Partiful
  (Settings → Calendar Sync → Apple Calendar, swap `webcal://` for `https://`),
  how to set the repo secret, how to deploy on GitHub Pages
- [x] End-to-end check: fresh clone simulation — script on fixture, open site,
  confirm rides render; fix anything broken

## Discovered work

(append new tasks here as `- [ ]` items; treat them as part of the Backlog)
