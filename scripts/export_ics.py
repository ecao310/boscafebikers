"""Re-export the upcoming rides as a public, subscribable calendar.

    python scripts/export_ics.py <events.json> --out site/rides.ics

The site already lets a visitor download one ride at a time (the browser builds
that .ics in site/js/ride-card.js). This writes the *whole* upcoming list once,
so a visitor can subscribe to the URL and let their calendar app keep itself up
to date. It reads only the committed events payload — it never touches the
private feed URL (PARTIFUL_ICS_URL), and nothing derived from it is in the
payload either.

Two rules keep the file from churning in git every six hours:

* DTSTAMP comes from the payload's `updated_at`, never datetime.now(), so the
  same payload always produces byte-identical output.
* The file is rewritten only when its bytes actually changed.

Both matter because the sync workflow commits whatever this leaves behind — see
the "Order matters" notes in CLAUDE.md; the workflow runs this on the *promoted*
site/events.json, which only changes when the rides do.

The UID of each VEVENT matches BCB.buildIcs() in site/js/ride-card.js exactly,
so a visitor who subscribes *and* downloaded a single ride sees one event, not
two. Keep the two in step.

Stdlib only. Exits 0 whether or not it rewrote the file; nonzero only when the
source is missing or unparseable.
