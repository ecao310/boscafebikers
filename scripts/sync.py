"""Run the whole ride-data sync in one process, in the one order that works.

    python scripts/sync.py --data-dir _data      # on the sync runner
    python scripts/sync.py --data-dir site       # locally, after scripts/pull_data.sh

Fetch the feed, absorb the rides that have already happened, backfill a few
archived ones, mirror a few ride photos, geocode any new café, draw the maps
that are missing, publish the upcoming list, re-export the public calendar —
then write only the files
whose content actually changed. A quiet sync writes zero bytes, which is the
property the workflow's "commit if changed" guard depends on.

The order used to live in the YAML of the sync workflow, where nothing could
test it. It lives in ``STEPS`` now, and tests/test_sync.py reorders that tuple
to prove each rule still bites:

* **archive before promote** — the archive is merged from the *previously*
  committed events.json, so a ride that has since started is kept even if
  Partiful already dropped it from the feed.
* **maps before promote** — render_route_maps adds ``map_image``, which a fresh
  fetch never carries; add it after publishing and the committed file can never
  equal the next fetch, so every run commits a new ``updated_at`` forever.
* **posters before promote** — same rule, same reason: the poster mirror adds
  ``poster``, and a fetch never carries that either.
* **the ICS export after promote** — its DTSTAMP comes from the payload's
  ``updated_at``, which is stamped fresh every run. Exported from the freshly
  fetched payload the calendar would churn every 6 hours; exported from the
  published events.json it only moves when the rides do.

Offline: ``--ics-file`` reads a local feed and makes zero network calls (no
enrichment, no geocoding, no router, no tiles), exactly like
``fetch_rides.py --ics-file``. Tests get the same offline run *with* the
enrichment steps by injecting stubs through ``run()``'s keyword seams.

Every external step is fail-soft, which is right and also silent: a Partiful
markup change would leave every new ride with no photo, no route and no map and
nothing would say so. So the run counts what it got — see ``Report`` — prints
the counts, writes them beside the data as ``sync-report.json``, and raises
GitHub annotations when a count says something is degraded. **Warnings are
annotations, never failures**: the exit status is exactly what it always was.

The feed URL comes from PARTIFUL_ICS_URL and is never printed — not in logs,
not in error messages. Exits nonzero only when the feed can't be fetched or
parsed (or a local data file is malformed); an enrichment miss is soft, as
everywhere else in this pipeline.
