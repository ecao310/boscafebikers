"""The display fields the browser used to work out for itself.

The site's rule is that every string a page prints is computed here, in the
sync, and the browser only reads it: that is why a visitor in Tokyo sees the
same Eastern date as one in Somerville. Four values were still being derived in
JavaScript, each a hand-kept twin of a Python rule — the grace hour, the
Bluebikes-dock start name, the café name/address split, and the year a ride
happened. They live here now, once, and `derive()` writes them onto every
event the sync stores:

    grace_until   when a ride stops being "rolling now" (start + GRACE_PERIOD)
    place_name    "O'Some Café, 100 Main St, …" → "O'Some Café"
    address       …and the rest of it, "100 Main St, Watertown, MA 02472"
    year          "2026", off the ISO start
    routes[].start_name / .end_name   the card's and the map's route labels

Pure functions, no I/O and no network, stdlib only (archive_events.py imports
this and must stay that way). `derive()` is idempotent and doesn't mutate its
argument, which is what lets the sync run it over the whole archive every time:
the fields are a function of stored data, so a change to a rule here reaches
every ride on the next sync with no backfill script and no network calls.
