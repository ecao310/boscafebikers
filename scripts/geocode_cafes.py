"""Geocode the café addresses in the ride payloads into site/cafe-points.json.

    python scripts/geocode_cafes.py --cache site/cafe-points.json \
        site/events-past.json site/events.json

cafes.html draws a pin per café on a Leaflet map, and the ride payloads carry
no coordinates — only the free-form `location` string the organizer typed into
Partiful. So the sync geocodes those strings once, through OpenStreetMap's
Nominatim, and commits the answers as a cache.

Two properties make that cheap and churn-free:

* **A known location is never queried again.** Both hits and resolved misses
  are remembered, so a run costs one request per café that has never been seen
  — which is zero on almost every sync, and one the week a new café appears.
* **The file is rewritten only when the mapping changed** (the same no-churn
  guard promote_events.py and archive_events.py keep). No timestamp is stamped
  into it, so a no-op run leaves the bytes byte-identical.

A *resolved* miss (Nominatim answered, with nothing) is recorded in "missing"
and never retried — `--retry-missing` is the manual escape hatch. A *transport*
failure (timeout, 5xx, no network) is not recorded at all, so a Nominatim
outage never poisons the cache; the location is simply looked at again next
sync. Either way the ride keeps its card and just gets no pin: fail-soft, like
every other enrichment here.

Nominatim's usage policy caps this at one request a second and asks for an
identifying User-Agent — DELAY and USER_AGENT below, and --limit bounds a run.

Stdlib only, and it never touches the ICS feed or its secret.
