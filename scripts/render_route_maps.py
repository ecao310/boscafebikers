"""Draw a route map for every ride that has one, and point the ride at it.

    python scripts/render_route_maps.py --out-dir site/maps --url-prefix maps \\
        site/events.json site/events-past.json

For each ride whose first measured route carries coordinates, this fetches the
route geometry from BRouter and the basemap tiles under it from OpenStreetMap,
renders
them with scripts/route_map.py, writes ``<out-dir>/<uid>.svg``, and sets the
ride's ``map_image`` to the site-relative path. The ride card prefers
``map_image`` over the Partiful poster.

Idempotent by design: a ride whose finished SVG already exists is skipped, so
the 6-hour sync only ever draws maps for rides it hasn't drawn yet, and
re-running costs nothing. "Finished" means drawn with its basemap: a map drawn
while the tile server was unreachable is written anyway (the route alone beats
no map) but left unmarked, and gets redrawn on a later run. ``--redraw`` forces
every map to be drawn again, for when the style changes. Fail-soft everywhere —
a ride with no route, no coordinates, or an unreachable router simply keeps
whatever image it had.

Exits nonzero only if a payload file is missing or unparseable.
